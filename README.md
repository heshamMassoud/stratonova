# Stratonova™
Stratonova™ is your running buddy. Stratonova™ is a [Strava](strava.com) add-on application. Stratonova™ summarises your run right after you finish it. No need for input from you. Just finish your run and enjoy a witty storytelling summary automatically posted on your strava activity.

Stratonova™ will also name your run according to the type of run it was from each of the following:
- Interval training 💪🛤️
- Short but Sweet 💁🏽‍♂️
- Long Run ☄️
- Threshold Training 🚀🚀🚀
- Easy Flow 🌊🌊

## Future Work
In the future, Stratonova™ will do more spicy things like post your run story on socials (e.g. instagram, twitter) automatically. So you don't have to do any manual work after you finished your run.



### Run locally
